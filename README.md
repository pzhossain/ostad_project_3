<h2># Add Task</h2>

Allow users to add a new task by typing it in an input box and clicking a button.

Tasks should not be empty or contain only spaces.

Clicking on a task should mark it as "done" (with a line-through style) or undo it.

<h2>#Delete Task</h2>

Add a "Delete" button next to each task to remove it.

<h2>#Save Tasks</h2>

All tasks should be saved in a file (tasks.json) so they remain even after reloading the page.

<h2># Redirect After Action</h2>

After adding, marking, or deleting a task, the page should reload automatically.

<h2># UI Design (If you don't know HTML CSS please follow project's live class)</h2>

Create a simple and clean layout for the app.

Use basic CSS or a library like Milligram for styling.
